## 🎯 Usage

### Training a Model
```python
# Example training script
from utils.data_loader import load_dataset
from models.cnn_classifier import BrainTumorCNN

# Load and preprocess data
train_data, test_data = load_dataset()

# Initialize model
model = BrainTumorCNN()

# Train the model
model.train(train_data, epochs=50)
```

### Making Predictions
```python
# Load trained model
model = BrainTumorCNN()
model.load_weights('models/best_model.h5')

# Make prediction on new MRI scan
prediction = model.predict(new_scan)
```
